A list of the first commands I run on a new Debian LXC to homogenize and secure my new environment.

<!--more-->

## Utilities

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
```

```bash
apt install curl nano openssl rsync fail2ban unattended-upgrades apt-listchanges sudo -y
```

## Don't use root

It is critical that you don't use root for SSH or for typical CLI tasks. I always create a new user for that reason.

```bash
useradd -m -g users -G sudo patrick
chsh -s /bin/bash patrick
passwd patrick
```

## SSH Configuration

I always disallow login for root over SSH and allow password logins for other users. To do this, edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`. You're looking to uncomment and modify the following lines:

```bash
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

```conf
# Authentication:
LoginGraceTime 2m
PermitRootLogin no
StrictModes yes
MaxAuthTries 6
MaxSessions 2

-----

# To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change to no here!
PasswordAuthentication no
PermitEmptyPasswords no
```

Once you've made the changes, you can restart the LXC and use SSH with your new user.
